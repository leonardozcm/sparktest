Examples for the Learning Spark book. These examples require a

number of libraries and as such have long build files.

We have also added a stand alone example with minimal
dependencies and a small build file in

the mini-complete-example directory.

These examples have been updated to run against Spark 1.3

so they may be slightly different

than the versions

in your copy of "Learning Spark".
